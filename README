# 👋 Hi, I'm Gustavo Marinho

I'm a **Systems Analysis and Development (ADS)** student at **UNINTER**, building portfolio projects across **Full-Stack Development (Java/Spring + React)** and **Cybersecurity (ethical, lab-based practice)**.

I like turning ideas into **clean, well-structured applications** with real CRUD flows, solid typing, and a good developer experience.

---

## 🧠 Focus areas
- **Full-Stack Development:** Java 21, Spring Boot, React, TypeScript
- **REST APIs:** validation, pagination/filtering, error handling
- **Frontend UI/UX:** responsive interfaces, feedback states, clean UX
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, migrations (Flyway)
- **DevOps basics:** Docker / Compose, GitHub Actions
- **Cybersecurity (academic / labs):** defensive studies, ethical practice

## 🚀 Featured projects

### ✅ Task Manager — Full Stack (Backend + Frontend)
A **portfolio-ready full-stack Task Manager** built with **Java 21 + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL** on the backend and **React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind** on the frontend.

It includes:
- Full CRUD
- Pagination, search, filters, sorting
- JWT authentication (protected routes)
- AI-powered priority suggestion (JWT-protected endpoint)
- Security documentation and local pentest evidence (Kali lab, controlled scope)

**Live Demo (Frontend):** https://gustavomprado.github.io/task-manager-frontend/  
**API (Backend):** https://task-manager-api-njza.onrender.com  
**Health:** https://task-manager-api-njza.onrender.com/actuator/health  

> **Note:** Render Free may have a **cold start** (~50s) on the first request.

- Backend: https://github.com/GustavoMPrado/task-manager-api
- Frontend: https://github.com/GustavoMPrado/task-manager-frontend

**Backend docs (security / pentest)**
- Security notes: https://github.com/GustavoMPrado/task-manager-api/blob/main/SECURITY.md
- Local pentest report (Kali, controlled lab): https://github.com/GustavoMPrado/task-manager-api/blob/main/docs/PENTEST.md

## 🛡️ Cybersecurity portfolio (ethical / lab-based)
I’m building my cybersecurity portfolio with **authorized, lab-only testing** and **defensive validation**, focused on documenting real evidence in systems I built myself.

Current highlights (Task Manager API):
- JWT-protected endpoints validated (`401` without token / `200` with token)
- Input validation tested (`400` on invalid payloads, no `500`)
- Pagination abuse mitigation validated (page size cap)
- Local lab pentest evidence collected from **Kali Linux** (VirtualBox, Host-Only network)
- Security and pentest documentation published in the backend repository

---

## 🛣️ Next improvements (planned)
- **Task Manager hardening (next iterations):** additional security checks and documentation refinements
- **Task Manager AI (next iterations):** expand AI features beyond priority suggestion
- **Portfolio packaging:** polish project documentation and recruiter-facing presentation
