# 👋 Hi, I'm Gustavo Marinho

I’m a **Systems Analysis and Development (ADS)** student at **UNINTER**, building portfolio projects across **Full-Stack Development (Java/Spring + React)** and **Cybersecurity (ethical, academic labs)**.

I like turning ideas into **clean, well-structured applications** with real CRUD flows, solid typing, and a good developer experience.

---

## 💻 Focus areas
- **Full-Stack Development:** Java + Spring Boot, React, TypeScript
- **REST APIs:** validation, pagination/filtering, error handling
- **Frontend UI/UX:** responsive interfaces, feedback states, clean UX
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, migrations (Flyway)
- **DevOps basics:** Docker / Compose, Git/GitHub
- **Cybersecurity (academic):** defensive studies, ethical lab practice

## 🧪 Featured projects

### ✅ Task Manager — Full Stack (Backend + Frontend)
A **portfolio-ready full-stack Task Manager** with real-world list UX: **pagination, search, filters, sorting**, plus full CRUD.

**Highlights**
- UI: pagination, search (`q`), filters (status/priority), sorting, page size
- Inline PATCH updates for status/priority
- UX: toast notifications + busy overlay
- Local run: Docker Compose or Windows scripts
